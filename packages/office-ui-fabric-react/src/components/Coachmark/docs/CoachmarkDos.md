- Only one Coachmark + TeachingBubble combo should be displayed at a time
- Coachmarks can be stand alone or sequential. Sequential Coachmarks should be used sparingly, to walk through complex multi-step interactions. It is recommended that a sequence of Coachmarks does not exceed 3 steps.
- Coachmarks are designed to only hold TeachingBubbles.
